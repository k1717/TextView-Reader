# Privacy

TextView Reader is designed as an offline local reader. The app does not include an account system, analytics, advertising, cloud sync, telemetry, or any developer-operated server upload path. The default manifest does not request the `INTERNET` permission.

## What the app does not include

- No analytics SDK.
- No advertising SDK.
- No account system.
- No cloud sync backend.
- No remote telemetry collection.
- No in-app network update check.
- No automatic developer contact or log upload.

## Android backup policy

The app manifest sets:

```xml
android:allowBackup="false"
```

This is intentional. App-private settings, reading metadata, recent-file metadata, bookmarks, display rules, cache bookkeeping, and the optional PIN state are not opted into Android Auto Backup by the app.

This does not stop actions outside the app, such as the user manually exporting settings, copying files, using a device/OEM transfer tool, using rooted-device tools, or backing up the whole device through another mechanism. Exported backup files and copied app data should still be treated as user data.

## Data stored locally

The app may store local data needed for reading and file-browser behavior:

- recent files and recent folders;
- user-added folder shortcuts;
- reading positions;
- bookmarks and bookmark labels;
- reader, toolbar, sort, and view settings;
- theme settings and custom reading themes;
- optional imported fonts;
- optional PIN-lock enabled state and salted PIN verifier;
- PDF reading-mode preference;
- saved TXT display rules, including rule text, scope, enabled state, case-sensitivity setting, regex setting, ordering, and source-file labels/paths used for current-file-only rules;
- disposable TXT page/index cache metadata for large-file handling;
- temporary extracted archive entries used when opening files from archives.

This data is used locally by the app. It is not uploaded by TextView Reader.

## Folder shortcuts and file paths

Folder shortcuts and recent-file records may store local path strings selected or opened by the user. They are used only for app navigation, restoring reading state, and showing faster drawer/recent entries. Removing a shortcut or recent entry removes the app metadata; it does not delete the underlying user folder or file.

## Archive browsing and extraction

Opening a file inside an archive may temporarily extract that selected entry into app cache so the appropriate viewer can read it. Long-press archive extraction writes files only after the user chooses a destination and confirms the extraction/conflict choice. Temporary archive cache data is disposable and is not a cloud upload or network transfer.

## Opening or sharing files with other apps

Some file types that TextView Reader does not render internally, such as video files, may be handed to another app through Android's normal open-with / viewer intent flow. Sharing also uses Android's normal user-triggered share flow.

For these flows, TextView Reader grants the chosen external app temporary read access to the selected file URI through Android `FileProvider`. TextView Reader does not upload the file itself. The receiving app decides what it does with the file after the user chooses it.

## APK installation behavior

The default build does not request `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` and does not route APK files into Android's package-installer flow. This avoids treating TextView Reader as an APK installer or app-update mechanism.

## TXT display rules and actual-file editing

TXT display rules are stored locally and may be included in user-triggered settings backup/import. Normal display rules change only the viewer output and do not edit the source TXT file.

The separate **Edit Actual TXT File** action is user-triggered and can write changed text into local storage. Original mode overwrites the current TXT file. Copy mode writes to `*_edited.txt` and overwrites that edited copy if it already exists. These file writes happen only after explicit confirmation in the app. The app writes through a temporary file in the same folder before replacing the target, but the user should still treat original-file editing as destructive because there is no internal undo.

## Bookmark/settings export and import

Backup/export uses JSON. The exported JSON can include file paths, file names, reading positions, bookmark labels, excerpts, app settings, layout settings, display rules, and custom reading themes. Treat exported backup files as user data.

Lock PIN data is intentionally excluded from the plain JSON backup. New PIN values are stored as salted PBKDF2 verifier strings rather than as a plain PIN. Legacy plain-PIN preferences from older installs are migrated to the verifier format after the first successful PIN verification. The optional PIN lock is still only an app-level convenience lock and is not a substitute for Android device encryption, lock-screen security, or secure storage of sensitive documents.

## Manual update link

Settings shows the static line `Check updates at https://github.com/k1717/TextView-Reader/releases`. Tapping that line copies the release URL to the clipboard. The app does not call the GitHub API, does not perform in-app update checks, and does not run background update checks.

## Developer contact button

Settings includes a **Contact developer** button for `textview.ahnyb@addy.io`. Tapping it opens the user's installed mail app through a `mailto:` intent with that address and a default subject. TextView Reader does not send email itself, does not collect the user's email address, and does not transmit logs, files, settings, bookmarks, or reading history automatically. Any message content, attachments, sender address, and network transmission are controlled by the user's chosen mail app.

If no mail app is available, the app copies the contact address to the clipboard so the user can paste it elsewhere.

## File permissions

The app requests storage access so it can open local documents selected by the user and act as a local file browser. On Android versions that require scoped-storage handling, the app may request broader storage access for file-browser behavior. These permissions are for local file access; they are not paired with an app network upload path.

## Generated cache data

Disposable TXT page/index cache bookkeeping and temporary archive-entry extraction data are used only for generated cache data under app cache storage. Cache cleanup must not remove bookmarks, reading history, saved reading position, folder shortcuts, or user documents.
